# Machine Programming Server Protocol

We have language server protocol right now. This is a relic of the past. We need something that is more inline with the AGI age.
I am calling it the "Machine Programming Server Protocol". As a machine programmer/refiner, you attach your "Console" to 1 or many machine programming servers. This is anagolous to the way that we, today, open our Discord or Slack client app to connect to discord servers of slack workspaces.
